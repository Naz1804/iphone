# iPhone 15 Pro Landing Page
This project is a clone of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro landing page, created by following _[Adrian Hajdin](https://github.com/adrianhajdin/iphone)_'s tutorial. It helped me learn and implement `GSAP` animations and integrate 3D objects using `Three.js` within a `React` project.

Credit goes to Adrian Hajdin for the original project and tutorial. This clone serves as a learning exercise to understand `GSAP`, `Three.js`, and their applications in web development.
